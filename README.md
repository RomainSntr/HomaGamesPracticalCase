# HomaGamesPracticalCase
 
This game was created as part of a practical case for Homa Games.

This is a stacking/collecting : use barrels to gain height and avoid the obstacles on your way, while collecting as much gems as possible. Baloons make you fly for a short time, allowing you to avoid any obstacle. There is only one level, but your gem count is saved when you retry it.

Controls : drag your finger on the screen to the left or to the right to move your character accordingly.
